## Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sylvia, but you may know me as PolarisðŸŒŒ. 

I'm a final year Computer Science/Economics student at UNSW and an aspiring Frontend Developer, with experience in React, Tailwind, Node.js, Firebase, Figma and more. 

# Here are some fun facts about me:
- ðŸ”­I have been contributing to [Structs.sh](https://structs.sh/), an algorithms visualiser under [UNSW Software Development Society](https://devsoc.app/), for two years now. As its Frontend Director of 2025, I'm currently leading the team to implement visualisation for Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Djikstras etc).
- ðŸ¦€I have been exploring Rust by building a Discord weather bot called [meteo.rs](https://github.com/PolarisXII/meteo.rs).
- ðŸ›¹In my free time, I like to cruise around on my skateboard along the harbour.
